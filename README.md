# Nexus Digital Marketing Agency
http://nexusagency.am/

I created this website for Nexus Digital Marketing Agency to showcase their services and expertise in helping businesses grow online. Built using React, the site features a clean and user-friendly design, making it easy to navigate and explore their offerings like social media management, online advertising, and website design.

This project reflects my process of turning ideas into functional, responsive, and visually appealing websites, focusing on simplicity and usability to deliver the best user experience.
